### Hi there 👋

I am a Frontend Developer with over three years of relevant experience who is passionate about creating exciting code, collaborating with like-minded developers, and contributing to side projects in my free time. Some technologies I enjoy using are Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Sass, and JavaScript.

🚀 I am currently a Frontend Developer at HealthStream in the Capitol View area of Nashville, Tennessee.  I earned my B.S. in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento in May of 2021, and decided to move to Nashville during my Senior year of college.  While taking online classes, I met some incredible people that have helped shape me into the person I am today.

☁️ During my free time, I like to improve my side projects as well as learn new front-end technologies; I am currently learning Machine Learning and AI.
