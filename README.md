### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a Front End Developer who is passionate about creating exciting and beneficial code, collaborating with like-minded individuals, and creating technology that is fun and up-lifting.  Some technologies I enjoy using are HTML and CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS.

I am currently a Front End Developer at Electronic Express in Nashville, Tennessee.  I studied Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento and decided to move to Nashville during my Senior year of college.  While taking online classes, I met some incredible people that have helped shape me into the person I am today.

I am working on a ReactJS project at the moment, which utilizes several different components which creates a Quiz-like experience.
