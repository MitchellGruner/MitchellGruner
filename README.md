### Hi there 👋

I am a Mid Level Front End Developer with nearly two years of experience who is passionate about creating exciting code, collaborating with like-minded developers, and contributing to side projects in my free time. Some technologies I enjoy using are Next.js, Tailwind, TypeScript, Sass, and JavaScript.

I am currently a Mid Level Front End Developer at Electronic Express in Nashville, Tennessee.  I earned my B.S. in Computer Science at California State University, Sacramento in May of 2021, and decided to move to Nashville during my Senior year of college.  While taking online classes, I met some incredible people that have helped shape me into the person I am today.

☁️ During my free time, I like to improve my side projects as well as learn new front end technologies. I am currently improving my skills, as well as contributing to open-source projects.
